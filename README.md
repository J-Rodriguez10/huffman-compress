## Huffman Coding - about the project:
This is one of the group projects I did at Evergreen Valley Community College ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ².

Huffman coding is a data compression algorithm that reduces the size of files by encoding the data more efficiently based on character frequency. This project includes two main components: compressing files and decompressing. The compression process involves analyzing the frequency of characters in a file, constructing a Huffman tree to generate unique binary codes for each character, and then writing those binary codes onto a new compressed file. Decompression involves reading the Huffman codes and tree to reconstruct the original data.

The CompressFile class handles the compression process, while the DecompressFile class manages the decompression. All of this is done through the terminal.

Overall, this project showcases a solid foundation for Java programming.
